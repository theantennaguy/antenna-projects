This repository contains board files and/or mechanical files of antennas I showcase on my blog. Info can also be found in the 'documentation' folder of each antenna.

All board/mechanical designs under this repository are licensed under CERN-OHL-S v2. You can check the license located at the base of the repository. You can also find it here https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt.
